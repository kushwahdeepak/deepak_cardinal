                An applicant tracking system provides the foundation
                for many corporate talent acquisition departments.
                These applicant tracking systems do what the name
                implies: they track applicants. They also store
                information such as resumes, perform keyword
                searches, help companies with government rules, etc.
                And to that end, they do the job.

                The reality is that companies design ATSs to hire
                people who’ve done a job similar to one that’s open
                today. But for the companies whose businesses are
                changing rapidly, hiring someone based on specific
                experience isn’t sufficient. Take, for example, this

                    fast that they can no longer recruit for
                    specific positions or jobs. Rather, her teams

                    expertise and recruit them into jobs needing
                    these skills. This is a big trend in AI, machine
                    learning, and cyber, where the core disciplines
                    are advancing so fast that companies can’t hire

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Like this pharma company, many employers need to be
                future-ready. They need to hire for jobs that
                haven’t been created yet. So they need to hire
                people for potential and capabilities – not
                experience. Their ATS is not enough.
            </span>
        </p>
        <h2>ATS + AI = Talent Intelligence</h2>
        <p>
            A system of talent intelligence, on the other hand, is
            designed to hire for potential. It considers an
            applicant’s “adjacent skills” – enabling them to succeed
            in an open role.

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Here are some of what companies can do by pairing an
                ATS with artificial intelligence:

            </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Adding the deep-learning capabilities of AI to
                searches helps bring people with the potential to do
                the job to the surface. By identifying adjacent
                skills and delivering far more relevant profiles, an
                employer increases the number of qualified
                candidates in their talent pipeline.
            </span>
        </p>

            </span>
        </h3>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                AI helps find people in a “Talent Network,” which
                includes past applicants, employee referrals, and
                “silver medalists” who may not have been a fit
                before but are now. We’ve found that companies that
                pair AI with an applicant tracking system find that
                roughly one-third of new hires coming from past
                applicants.

        </h3>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                A Talent Network is more than a database of past
                applicants. It can include employee referrals,
                ex-employees, and even current employees. In fact,
                we’ve seen from our customers that a Talent Network
                averages roughly about 200 times the number of
                employees at a company. So, as a rule of thumb, if
                you have 10,000 employees, you have something on the
                order of a 2 million person Talent Network when
                pairing an ATS with a capable AI platform. And more
                data equals better search results and more qualified
                candidates.

        </h3>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                With AI, companies can see who the strongest matches
                are for any job, regardless of whether these matches
                are past applicants, ex-employees, passive/sourced
                employees, or referrals with the potential to
                succeed. This saves time and improves quality of
                hire.

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                An AI platform understands the capabilities,
                including current skills and learnable skills, of
                every individual. Without this, with just an ATS,
                companies often default to “who has done the exact
                job we’re hiring for” based on antiquated keyword
                searches.
            </span>

        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Within a career site powered by talent intelligence,
                candidates can immediately find the right job for
                them. They’ll also understand the reasons why that
                job is a fit for their qualifications and potential.
                This improves engagement and measurably lowers
                drop-off rates. Companies can also add a chatbot to
                improve the candidate experience and handle employee
                queries more efficiently.

                Rarely does an applicant tracking system come
                equipped with the kind of technology you find in
                leading sales and marketing platforms. (Heck, many
                of the CRM systems made for the talent industry are
                lacking as well.) The ATS-AI combination, though,
                nurtures candidates in a pipeline based on their
                interests and delivers content of interest to them.
                Veterans, for example, can receive blog posts or

                all women engineers in its database of potential
                candidates, saying NextRoll would be at the
                conference. “We got an incredible response that
                greatly exceeded our expectations,” Global Head of
                Talent Jody Atkins recalls. “People came up to us
                and said they received our email and wanted to seek
                us out. That was really rewarding. And it helped our

                attract them to your company,” Atkins says. “Our
                engineers are encouraged to write blogs, and we use
                Eightfold to identify the subset of people in our

                Virtual and in-person events are just so much more
                effective with the AI-ATS combination; it allows
                companies to spend their event time on the people
                who are strong matches for your jobs.

                recruiter’s efficiency and the quality of candidates
                through AI-enabled candidate matching. It was a
                single place to review and manage registration,
                assessment, and candidate experience.”

                When asked to break down how they spend their days,
                many recruiters will tell you they wished they were
                doing a lot more… recruiting. Instead, recruiters
                get bogged down coordinating schedules. Adding an
                AI-based interview-scheduling system to an applicant
                tracking system frees recruiters up to do what’s
                most valuable and more fulfilling:

                Augmenting your ATS with the right platform offers
                ready-to-use, real-time reporting for diversity,
                CRM, recruiting pipeline, and other talent
                functions. So, with some legacy systems, a company
                may just see that it has a “diversity problem” if it
                can determine how many women, to take one example,
                work at different levels of the company. You can
                hone in on the problem with talent intelligence: are
                people from under-represented groups dropping off at
                the screening stage? The interview? Not accepting
                offers? In which departments/managers is the problem
                the worst? In the end, identifying the specific
                problem helps get to a solution.&nbsp;&nbsp;
            </span>
        </p>
        <h2>Pair Your ATS with AI</h2>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                The bottom line is that, for the most part, an ATS
                actually does do what humans designed it to do. By
                definition, it’s a system of tracking and storage
                that relies on keyword matching based on the
                candidate’s experience. However, it is not a talent
                intelligence system – one that provides the ability
                to hire based on adjacent skills, as-yet untapped
                potential, and capabilities.&nbsp;
            </span>
        </p>
        <p>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">
                Pairing an ATS with AI – and creating a talent
                intelligence platform – can dramatically increase
                your return on investment. And it can drive the
                right candidates into your talent funnel. Yes, even
                for jobs that didn’t exist until now.
